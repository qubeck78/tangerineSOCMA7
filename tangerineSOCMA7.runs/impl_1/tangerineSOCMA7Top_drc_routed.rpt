BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer migDDR3Inst/u_migDDR3_mig/u_memc_ui_top_std/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[0].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs/IBUFDS_0 (in migDDR3Inst/u_migDDR3_mig/u_memc_ui_top_std/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[0].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer migDDR3Inst/u_migDDR3_mig/u_memc_ui_top_std/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[1].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs/IBUFDS_0 (in migDDR3Inst/u_migDDR3_mig/u_memc_ui_top_std/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[1].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0 output picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0 output picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0 multiplier stage picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0 multiplier stage picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#3 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg multiplier stage picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

DPOP-2#4 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg__0 multiplier stage picorv32Inst/pcpi_mul/rd_reg__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0).

PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A5' of cell UARTInst/rxFiFoInst/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.rd/gr1.gr1_int.rfwft/gpregsm1.user_valid_i_1 (pin UARTInst/rxFiFoInst/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.rd/gr1.gr1_int.rfwft/gpregsm1.user_valid_i_1/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6)+((~A6)*(~A2)*A3)'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal migDDR3Inst/u_migDDR3_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the migDDR3Inst/u_migDDR3_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of migDDR3Inst/u_migDDR3_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
